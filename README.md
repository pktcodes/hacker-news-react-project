#### Hacker News consists of a straight forward user interface where there is a
- List of stories by default is set to fetch **REACT**, a search form to query for specific stories as we are typing.
- **Search form** to query for a specific category of stories and the stories matching the query are fetched on changing every word. If no matching stories are found, it returns nothing. 
- To read more details of a specific story/article in the list, click on the **Read more**, and to remove a story from displaying on UI, click on **Remove**.
- Buttons have been implemented to move between different pages of the stories, **Prev** for going to the previous page and **Next** for going to the next page along with **page numbers**.
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to start up the development server on default port 3000.
